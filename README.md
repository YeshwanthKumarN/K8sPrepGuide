# K8sPrepGuide
A centralized repository for all my Kubernetes learning materials.

Started with Kubernetes ingress [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/]
For hands on lab > https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/14/course_templates/660/labs/405090.
A well curated lab helps to learn the relations between ingress, services, GKE NW & HTTP LoadBalancers. Keep more attention in understanding the capabilities which helps in designing & taking key decissions on chosing right components.
Note: Refer back to Kubernetes document after finishing the lab, to cement the learning.
