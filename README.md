1. Started with Kubernetes ingress [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/]
2. For hands on lab > https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/14/course_templates/660/labs/405090.
3. This well curated lab helps to learn the relations between ingress, services, GKE NW & HTTP LoadBalancers. Keep more attention in understanding the capabilities which helps in designing & taking key decissions on chosing right components.
4. Note: Refer back to Kubernetes document after finishing the lab, to cement the learning.
