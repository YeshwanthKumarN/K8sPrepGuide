# K8sPrepGuide
A centralized repository for all my Kubernetes learning materials.

1. Started with Kubernetes ingress [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/]
2. For hands on lab > https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/14/course_templates/660/labs/405090.
3. This well curated lab helps to learn the relations between ingress, services, GKE NW & HTTP LoadBalancers. Keep more attention in understanding the capabilities which helps in designing & taking key decissions on chosing right components.
4. Note: Refer back to Kubernetes document after finishing the lab, to cement the learning.

Today's Motivatition:
1. It’s You vs. You — a powerful truth. The real magic begins when you truly understand yourself.
2. Instill discipline, integrity, and obedience in your character — this is a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t rush, and don’t give up.
3. Seek a workplace that genuinely values your presence. Remember, Bodhidharma journeyed all the way from India to China for a purpose — and to this day, they honor him and uphold his teachings.

1. Completed analysis of GKE and CloudRun

1. Use of NEG in GKE Services
   Purpose: CloudRun LB supports NEG, and if GKE ALB also supports NEG instead of backend. Then a single ALB is deployed to both GKE and CloudRUN services.
